This is an **ongoing** social cataloguing app for users to score and track anime and manga, being built using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), and bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).


Was put on hold due to apprenticeship commitments, however - development has resumed!

This project is still in early stages of development, so If you notice any areas of improvements in this repo, do reach out to us!

## Prerequisites

You will need [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) version 8.0 or greater installed on your system.

## Setup

Unzip the application, open your terminal in the directory, and install all the required dependencies using:

```
npm install
```

Then, start the app with:

```
npm run dev
```

The app should now be up and running at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/) ðŸš€
